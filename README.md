# FontevaHackathon
This was written for a hackathon I attended during the summer of 2018. The goal was to read a large amount of sample json data from a file and create a store front with list and search capabilities. It had been a couple years since I had done any PHP coding at the point that I wrote this, and I had never worked with JSON data, but I was able to create this project in a couple hours. We were not given a test environment either, so I had to set that up in the alotted time as well. My result is pretty bare bones and is unfinished. During the hackathon I did not indent or comment the code properly but I have recently done that and uploaded the result.
